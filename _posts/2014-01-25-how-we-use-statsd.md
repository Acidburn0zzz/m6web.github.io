# What do we want

As developers we (m6web) want to keeps ours eyes open on what is going on in production.

Our [local CMO](https://twitter.com/kenny_dee) (chief monitoring officier ;) ) did a [nice presentation about this](http://www.slideshare.net/kennydee/monitoring-applicatif-pourquoi-et-comment) (in french).

As someone very wise (Theo Schlossnagle) said : "*It's not in production unless it's monitored*". Another cool mantra is : "*I am wondering what to monitor ? everything dude !*". Finally "*if you can not measure it, you can not improve it.*" ([Lord Kelvin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Thomson,_1st_Baron_Kelvin)).

We ship new apps very often, so we have to industrialise this practice.

# What is it ?

Stasd is node daemon allowing you to send metrics (increment values and add timers) over UDP. The fire and forget feature is great for reducing the risk of introducing latency in your application.

Statsd is [open sourced by etsy](https://github.com/etsy/statsd/). In our configuration, we use severals statsd dameons and aggregate metrics on graphite - one point per minute. Many servers allows us to scale, cause we dont sample the data at all.

Client side, we use a simple consistent hashing algorithm to dispatch metrics for a statsd node on the same server.

# Collecting metrics

## From raw PHP

We create a simple PHP lib to dispatch metrics over UDP. Check it ou on [Github](https://github.com/M6Web/Statsd) or [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/m6web/statsd).

The usage is pretty straitforward :

{% highlight php %}
<?php
// client creation
$client = new Statsd\Client(
                    array(
                        'serv1' => array('address' => 'udp://200.22.143.12'),
                        'serv2' => array('port' => 8125, 'address' => 'udp://200.22.143.12')
                    )
                );
// usage
$client->increment('a.graphite.node');
$client->timing('another.graphite.node', (float) $timing);
{% endhighlight %}

## From Symfony2

As basic Symfony2 fanboys, we build a [bundle](https://github.com/M6Web/StatsdBundle) on top of the statsd component.
It provided those features :

* manage multiple Symfony services with different configuration
* bind any event to increment nodes and collect timers

During the sf2 execution, metrics are collected and sended only at the kernel shutdown. A nice feature is that you can [easily collect basic metrics based on events](https://github.com/M6Web/StatsdBundle/blob/master/doc/usage.md#bind-on-events) without touching your code.

For exemple, in conjunction with the [M6Web\HttpKernelBundle](https://github.com/M6Web/HttpKernelBundle), just dropping this in ``config.yml``` is enought :

{% highlight yaml %}
m6_statsd:
    clients:
        default:
            servers: ['all']
            events:
              m6.terminate:
                increment:     request.yourapp.<status_code>.<route_name>
                timing:        request.yourapp.<status_code>.<route_name>
                custom_timing: { node: memory.yourapp.<status_code>.<route_name>, method: getMemory }
              m6kernel.exception:
                increment: errors.<status_code>.yourapp
{% endhighlight %}

![example of simple PHP dashboard](/images/posts/statsd/php_metrics.jpg)

Offering this to the tech team means that I am now pretty sure that almost new PHP apps pops with those metrics out of the box.

Please checkout [the bundle documentation on github](https://github.com/M6Web/StatsdBundle/blob/master/doc/toc.md).



## From anywhere else

From flex, mobile app or JS applications we developped a simple [nodejs app, translating an http call to a statsd udp one](https://github.com/M6Web/HttpToStatsd). Like the PHP implementation, this application shards the metrics over multiples servers.

Please consider sending metrics asynchronously and add a timeout to this http call.

# Living with metrics

About 120K metrics are collected on our platform. That's a lot.

Graphite dashboards are quiet rustics. But surprisingly lots of non-techs people use the tool : SEO experts, advertising managers, contributors, ...

For now we keep using Graphite. We are trying to keep dashboard organised and well named.

For alerting, [a tool based on graphite json output has been developped](/images/posts/statsd/mayday.jpg). It sends emails when it reach some user determined conditions. Honestly, it's doing the job. But frankly we are still looking for something else, more flexible with more notifications system than emails.

If you use such a tool, and your happy with it, please let us know in the comments.

Found a typo or bad english langage, just propose a [pull request](https://github.com/M6Web/m6web.github.io/blob/master/_posts/2014-01-25-how-we-use-statsd.md).
